Learning English is a basic requirement if you plan on doing business with Americans, but other aspects such as filing for your Employer Identification Number, and choosing which type of company you want to be, can make matters more confusing. Choose Your Company Structure  Most foreign nationals, says Schwartz International tax advisor and lawyer Richard Hartnig, choose to establish a C corporation, which can expand by offering unlimited stock and is typically more attractive to outside investors, even though its profits are taxed twice, first at the corporate level, and then as dividends to shareholders. For corporate shareholders, the advantages are usually clear: Corporate shareholders typically qualify for a lower dividend rate. And so long as the U.S. company doesn’t primarily hold real estate, the corporate parent won’t pay capital gains when it sells the U.S. affiliate. Even individual foreign owners are probably best off with a C corporation, says Hartnig, since the structure will shield them from direct I.R.S. scrutiny. “Foreign individuals are very, very hesitant to put their names on the U.S. tax rolls,” he says.
